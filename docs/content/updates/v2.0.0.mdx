# v2.0.0

We haven't had a release for 2 months, but this is a big one! It's the biggest update in the short history of Rybbit, and includes a minor breaking change (you just need to toggle some switches in the UI if affected) so I've decided to mark it as 2.0.

## Map/Globe Rework

The Map and Realtime pages have been replaced with the Globe page. There isn't a straight up 1-to-1 replacement of the Realtime page yet, but I might add it in a future release.

Leaflet has been replaced with Openlayers. I added a 3D mode using Mapbox, but I have left this feature out of the open source release because Mapbox requires a credit card to obtain an API key (even if you stay within the free tier). To be clear, the 2D map is in the self-hosted release.

### New Globe Features

- **Timeline view** where you can see and replay visits over time
- **Coordinates view** where you can see the approximate location of sessions
- Country and subdivision layers are largely the same

## Journeys Page Rework

- General UI redesign
- Added step path filter
- Hover interactions on nodes and connections now make more sense

## Goal and Funnel Improvements

- Added ability to clone goals and funnels
- Added search filter to goals and funnels

## User Identification Improvements

- Changed user avatar
- Now displays a random name for each user instead of the raw ID (ID is still available)

## Script Configs are now Server-side

**This is technically the breaking change of this 2.x release**

I didn't like how some of the configs were living on the tracking script and some were in the site settings UI, so I moved almost all of them to site settings. You no longer have to redeploy your script every time you want to update the tracking config.

For anyone currently setting fields on the tracking script, just head over to your site settings and toggle stuff on.

## Filter Improvements

- Fixed the "Event Name" filter. This was always broken in the past
- In the main tab you can now filter by events by clicking on them
- Added more filters to more pages, most notably the Hostname filter

## Optional IP Address Collection

You can now toggle visitor IP addresses. IP address collection is off by default because it is very privacy unfriendly, but it can be useful for debugging or blocking bots/spammers.

## Channel Information

Added channel information to the Sessions, Users, and Globe pages
